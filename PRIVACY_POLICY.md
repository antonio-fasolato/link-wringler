Privacy Policy for Link Wringer
Last Updated: February 2026

Link Wringer is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information through our Chrome Extension.

1. Data Collection
Link Wringer does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. * All processing of text selections and URL extraction happens locally on your machine.

We do not have access to your browsing history, your IP address, or the content of the pages you visit, except for the specific text you highlight and interact with via the context menu.

2. Data Usage
The extension uses the following permissions solely for functional purposes:

activeTab & scripting: To identify URLs within your highlighted text when you trigger the "Open" or "Copy" actions.

storage: To save your local preferences, such as whether to include plain-text links or which regex strictness to use.

clipboardWrite: To allow you to copy the extracted list of links to your clipboard.

3. Data Transmission
No data is ever sent to the internet. Link Wringer does not communicate with any external servers or third-party analytics services. All "Link Wringing" logic is contained entirely within the extension package.

4. Third-Party Access
Since we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, or trade any information with third parties.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.

6. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the GitHub repository issues page.
